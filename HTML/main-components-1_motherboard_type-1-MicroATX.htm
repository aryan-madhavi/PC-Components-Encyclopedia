      <em><strong>Micro ATX</strong></em> is a smaller motherboard form factor that <em>offers a more compact alternative to the larger ATX form factor</em>. Despite having fewer expansion slots and components, they are still appropriate for budget builds, HTPCs, and compact desktops. Because of their smaller size, they are more energy-efficient and suitable for low-power builds, but their performance in high-end builds may be limited.
      <br><br>
      Micro ATX also known as mATX. It is a smaller motherboard form factor that measures 244mm by 244mm. It usually has fewer expansion slots than ATX, usually up to four, including PCI, PCIe x1, and PCIe x16 slots. As a result, it is appropriate for compact desktop builds, low-cost builds, or applications that do not require a large number of expansion cards.
      <br><br>
      Due to more energy-efficient, they are suitable for low-power builds and HTPCs. Micro ATX motherboards are less expensive compared to ATX motherboards. One disadvantage of Micro ATX motherboards is the limited space available for components and cooling solutions. They have smaller heatsinks and fewer fan headers than ATX motherboards, limiting their performance in high-end builds. They also have a smaller I/O shield, which can limit the number of available ports and connectors.
