      <em><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong></em> is the <em>hardware in a computing device</em> where the operating system (OS), application programs and <em>data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor</em>. RAM is the <em>main memory</em> in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.
      <br><br>
      Random Access Memory is <em>volatile</em>. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.

      <img class="image" id="ram" src="src/main-components-4_ram(2).jpg" width="500">
      Because of its volatility, <em>RAM can't store permanent data</em>. RAM can be compared to a person's short-term memory, and a hard disk drive to a person's long-term memory. Short-term memory is focused on immediate work, but it can only keep a limited number of facts in view at any one time. When a person's short-term memory fills up, it can be refreshed with facts stored in the brain's long-term memory.
      <br><br>
      A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the computer's processor must repeatedly go to the hard disk to overlay the old data in RAM with new data. This process slows the computer's operation.
      <br><br>
      A computer's hard disk can become completely full of data and unable to take any more, but RAM won't run out of memory. However, the combination of RAM and storage memory can be completely used up.

      <span class="title">• Types of RAM:</span><div class="line"></div><br>
      RAM comes in two types of primary forms - 
      <dl>
        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)</dt>
        <dd>
        It makes up the typical computing device's RAM, and as was previously noted, it needs that power to be  on to retain stored data.<br>
        Each DRAM cell has a charge or lack of charge held in an electrical capacitor. This data must be constantly refreshed with an electronic charge every few milliseconds to compensate for leaks from the capacitator. A transistor serves as a gate, determining whether a capacitor's value can be read or written.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)</dt>
        <dd>
        It also needs constant power to hold on to data, but it doesn't need to be continually refreshed the way DRAM does.<br>
        In SRAM, instead of a capacitor holding the charge, the transistor acts as a switch, with one position serving as 1 and the other position as 0. Static RAM requires several transistors to retain one bit of data compared to dynamic RAM which needs only one transistor per bit. As a result, SRAM chips are much larger and more expensive than an equivalent amount of DRAM.
