      A lot of people know what a PC is, but most of the time they can't explain it when asked about it.
      <!-- https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer -->
      So, a <em><strong>Personal Computer (PC)</strong></em> is a digital computer designed for use by only one person at a time. A typical personal computer assemblage consists of a <em>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</em>, which contains the computer's <u>arithmetic</u>, <u>logic</u>, and <u>control circuitry on an integrated circuit</u>; two types of computer memory, main memory, such as digital random-access memory (RAM), and auxiliary memory, such as magnetic hard disks and special optical compact discs, or read-only memory (ROM) discs (CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs); and various peripheral devices, including a display screen, keyboard and mouse, and printer.

      The <em><strong>history of the personal computer</strong></em> as a mass-market consumer electronic device began with the <em>microcomputer revolution</em> of the 1970s. After the development of the microprocessor, individual personal computers were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods. Early personal computers - generally called microcomputers - were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians.

      Computer hardware includes the physical components of a computer. Personal computers (PCs) are electronic devices that use microchips to process information and may include desktop computers, laptops or tablets. Since a computer comprises many hardware components, they work together and depend on each other to function properly.<br><br>
