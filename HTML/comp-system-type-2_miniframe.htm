      <em><strong>Miniframe Computer</strong></em> is a <em>midsize multiprocessing computer</em>. It consists of two or more processors and can support <em>4 to 200 users at one time</em>. Miniframe computers are used in institutes and departments for tasks such as billing, accounting and inventory management. A minicomputer <em>lies between the mainframe and microcomputer</em> as it is smaller than mainframe but larger than a microcomputer.

      <span class="title">• Applications of Miniframe or Minicomputers:</span><div class="line"></div><br>
      A minicomputer is mainly used to perform three primary functions, which are as follows -<br>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Process control</b>: It was used for process control in manufacturing. It mainly performs two primary functions that are collecting data and feedback. If any abnormality occurs in the process, it is detected by the minicomputer and necessary adjustments are made accordingly.
      </li>
      <li><b>Data management</b>: It is an excellent device for small organizations to collect, store and share data. Local hospitals and hotels can use it to maintain the records of their patients and customers respectively.
      </li>
      <li><b>Communications Portal</b>: It can also play the role of a communication device in larger systems by serving as a portal between a human operator and a central processor or computer.
      </li>
      </ul>
