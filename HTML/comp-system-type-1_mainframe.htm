      <em><strong>Mainframe Computer</strong></em> are designed to support <em>hundreds of thousands of users</em> simultaneously. They can support <em>multiple programs</em> at the same time. It means that they can execute different processes simultaneously. These features of mainframe computers make them <em>ideal for big organizations</em> like banking and telecom sectors, which need to <em>manage and process high volumes of data</em>. It is a high capacity and costly.

      <ul>
        <li>It can process huge amount of data, e.g. millions of transactions in a second in the banking sector.
        </li>
        <li>It has a very long life. It can run smoothly for upto 50 years after proper installation.</li>
        <li>It gives excellent performance with large scale memory management.
        </li>
        <li>It has the ability to share or distribute its workload among other processors and input/output terminals.
        </li>
        <li>There are fewer chances of error or bugs during processing in mainframe computers. If any error occurs it can fix it quickly without affecting the performance.
        </li>
        <li>It has the ability to protect the stored data and other ongoing exchange of information and data.
