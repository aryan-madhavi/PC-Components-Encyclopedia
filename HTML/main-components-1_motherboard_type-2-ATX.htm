      <em><strong>ATX which stands for Advanced Technology eXtended</strong></em> is a motherboard form factor introduced by Intel in 1995. It is a <em>standard specification for the physical layout and design of personal computer motherboards</em>, and it has since become the most popular motherboard form factor for consumer desktop PCs.
      <br></br>
      It refers to a larger motherboard form factor that <em>measures 305mm by 244mm</em>. It usually has more expansion slots than Micro-ATX, making it <em>ideal for high-end gaming and workstation builds</em>. ATX motherboards typically have up to seven expansion slots, which include PCI, PCIe x1, PCIe x4, and PCIe x16 slots, allowing users to add multiple graphics cards, sound cards, network adapters, and other expansion cards.
      <br><br>
      ATX is the <em>standard form factor for the industries</em>. When larger cases are available, ATX motherboards have more options. In the case of a larger case, it opens the door to additional advanced options such as SLI or tri-SLI. Additional ports, such as USB, PCI, and SATA slots, can be included on full-size ATX motherboards.
      <br><br>
      The position of the power supply fan is an additional feature of the ATX motherboard. To improve cooling and reduce noise, air is blown directly onto the processor and expansion cards.

      Below lists all of the advantages ATX motherboards have over other types of motherboard form factors.
      <ol>
        <li>The ATX motherboard includes advanced control facilities, where the BIOS (basic input/output system) program continually checks the CPU (central processing unit) temperature and voltages, the cooling fans RPM (revolutions per minute), etc. If overheating occurs, the PC shuts down automatically.</li>
        <li>The ATX motherboard has a stacked I/O connector panel mounted on the motherboard.</li>
        <li>On a socket 7 ATX motherboard, the socket is placed a further distance from the expansion slots, allowing for long boards to be placed in easier.</li>
        <li>ATX 2.01 includes a single keyed, Molex internal power supply connector which cannot be placed improperly. However, its standby voltage needs to be greater than 720 mA. While the Molex power connector supports 5v and 3.3v, we recommend only a 3.3v be used.</li>
        <li>Relocation of the memory and the CPU allows better ventilation and easier installation.</li>
        <li>Power management is now possible with proper BIOS support.</li>
        <li>The PC can also be turned on by a modem or network signal, as the power supply is controlled by the main board.</li>
        <li>The computer cannot be turned off as the computer boots. However, if the computer freezes as it is turning on you can turn off the computer by holding the power button for five seconds.</li>
