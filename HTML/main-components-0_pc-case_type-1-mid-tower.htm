      Mid-tower or ATX format is the <em>most popular and widely used computer case</em> that allows you to use many drives and almost all types of motherboards with acceptable overall dimensions in it.
      <br><br>
      The average full tower ranges between <em>35- 55 cm tall and 15 - 25 cm in width</em>.
      <br><br>
      Inside the mid-tower case, there is more enough space for installing full-size components, such as most extensive video cards over 300 mm long, and this case is capable of using 120, 140, or even 200 mm fans size for a positive effect on cooling the air.
      <br><br>
      Using these types of computer cases, you can build a productive PC with a sound ventilation system. It is considered a universal option for desktop users because you can assemble a wide range of designs, a low-power office computer, a home media center, and a gaming computer.
      <br><br>
      This type of format includes both those developed for the mini ITX standard and those designed for the micro ATX standard. Therefore, you will find all the small computer cases in this segment, including many cube-shaped chassis or oriented for HTPC.
