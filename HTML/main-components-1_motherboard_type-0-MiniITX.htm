      <em><strong>Mini-ITX</strong></em> is a compact motherboard form factor measuring <em>170 x 170 mm (6.7 x 6.7 in)</em>. Mini-ITX boards are specifically designed for computer builds that require <em>full-featured capabilities in a compact footprint</em>. They're a popular choice for a wide range of consumer and industrial computing systems.
      <br><br>
      The Mini-ITX standard was <em>originally developed by VIA Technologies in 2001</em> to showcase chipsets and processors. The form factor was of <em>particular interest to industrial hardware builders</em> because it maintained many of the capabilities and connectivity options of larger boards while saving space and drawing less power. Mini-ITX boards are well suited for fanless cooling, making them <em>ideal for industrial and embedded systems that require high reliability in challenging environments</em>. OnLogic was among the first companies to make Mini-ITX boards available to the US market in 2003.

      Mini-ITX offers a number of advantages over its larger (and smaller) contemporaries. Of course, every application is unique, and your requirements will dictate which form factor has the right combination of features and performance for your project. That said, here's a summary of what Mini-ITX motherboards have to offer.
      <ol>
        <li><b>Small systems for space constrained applications</b>: Compact Mini-ITX PCs fit where most tower PCs don't.</li>
        <li><b>Power efficient, but highly capable</b>: Low power processors generate less heat which promotes system longevity. But they still deliver highly-capable processing, particularly with the latest processor generations.</li>
        <li><b>Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) boards lower cost, speeds time to market</b>: Standard, off the shelf Mini-ITX boards reduce the need for custom development.</li>
        <li><b>A range of suppliers and an established ecosystem</b>: Mini-ITX has been around for more than two decades and there are hundreds of board and enclosure options to choose from.</li>
        <li><b>Industrial solutions available</b>: Thanks to their flexibility, industrial manufacturers offer wide-temp, rugged, fanless, and long lifecycle board versions.</li>
        <li><b>Modularity and selection yield highly configurable solutions</b>: Mini-ITX enables customized configurations thanks to onboard pin headers and the capabilities of solution providers like OnLogic.</li>
