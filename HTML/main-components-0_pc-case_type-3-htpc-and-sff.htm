      HTPC stands '<b>Home theatre PC</b>' for and SFF stands for '<b>Small Form Factor</b>'. These types of cases were considered very niche, but in recent years they have gained popularity due to the miniaturization of powerful components that can fit in them.
      <br><br>
      HTPC is the <em>perfect choice for the computer at your home multimedia entertainment</em>. You can place it under the TV table, or even you can hang on the wall. And the computing power of this is more enough to play music and video in any modern format.
      <br><br>
      SFF takes little space. Due to their small size and lightweight, they can be an excellent alternative to laptops. Some SFFs are handy to come with handles or unique bags to make them easier to transport. Also, the SFF has a significant advantage over a laptop since it has more power at less cost.
      <br><br>
      Many SFFs come with motherboards by offering cooling options (silent) that differ from the standard noisy fans found in other types of computer cases.
      <br><br>
      This happens because the video and sound on such motherboards are built-in, leading to generating heat in a very tiny amount. As a result, they do not need powerful cooling. Also, this arrangement reduces the size.
      <br><br>
      SFF cases with Mini-ITX motherboard suits perfectly the people who work or play in tight spaces. These are specially for small living rooms and small offices. It will also be much easier to repair and improve such a PC than a laptop with the feature of portability.
