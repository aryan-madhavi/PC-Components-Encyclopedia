      These types of computer cases are designed to take up as little physical space and without installing decent-sized graphics cards. The average mini-tower length ranges between <em>30 - 45 cm tall and 15 - 25 cm in width</em> (they can sometimes be smaller).
      <br><br>
      Their thermal enclosures are not the best on the market, so it is more convenient for you to install low-consumption components rather than high-consumption ones.
      <br><br>
      The Mini Tower chassis is the <em>smallest in size and not very popular among computer assemblers</em> due to the limited volume, which does not allow assembly of a more or less productive computer and low airflow. A small body limits the choice of types of accessories too.
      <br><br>
      You can install only a microATX motherboard and a low power supply in these types of computer cases. Typically, Mini Tower computers are shipped in the most basic configuration for back-office machines or network terminals.
