      <em><strong>Supercomputers</strong></em> are the <em>biggest and fastest</em> computers. They are designed to process huge amount of data. A supercomputer can process <em>trillions of instructions in a second</em>. It has thousands of interconnected processors.
      <br><br>
      Supercomputers are particularly used in <em><strong>scientific and engineering applications</strong></em> such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations and nuclear energy research. The first supercomputer was developed by <em><strong>Roger Cray in 1976</strong></em>.
