      Firstly, Full Tower is <em>used to accommodate an E-ATX or CEB motherboard</em>. This is <em>very useful for high-performance servers</em> that can use multiple components all sizes of motherboard from high end expensive to cheap units at once.
      <br><br>
      The full tower ranges between <em>55 - 75 cm tall and 22 - 32 cm in width</em>. It can have from 4 to 9 5.25-inch bays (for additional optical drive). Allows you to install up to seven expansion cards, such as a WiFi card with a proper cable management for display, peripherls, and power supply connectors.
      <br><br>
      This type of computer case comes with proper size and weight, which usually has better internal cooling. Of course, their prices are a little high. 
      <br><br>
      Such a case provides better cooling for two top-end graphics cards, multiple RAM bars, and a processor like the Intel Core i9-9900K and allows you to create a custom cooling system with 230mm fans.
      <br><br>
      Buying a Full Tower is worth it, but only if you need space for a large number of components or need a lot of airflows to cool the powerful processors with hyperthreading tech as well as bulky RTX or Ti GPUs.
      <br><br>
      One big drawback to having a Full Tower is that it takes up a lot of space and is difficult to hide. But if you have free space available, then it is not essential for you, then Full Tower can be the best choice for your PC.
