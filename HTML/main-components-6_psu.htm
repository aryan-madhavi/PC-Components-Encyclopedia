      A Power Supply Unit, PSU is an internal IT hardware component. Despite the name, Power Supply Units (PSU) do not supply systems with power - instead they convert it. Specifically, a power supply converts the alternating high voltage current (AC) into direct current (DC), and they also regulate the DC output voltage to the fine tolerances required for modern computing components.

      Most power supplies are switched-mode (SMPS), which has both efficiency advantages and makes designing for multiple voltage inputs easier. This means that most PSUs can operate in different countries where the power input might change. In the UK, the voltage is 240V 50Hz, whereas in the USA the voltage is 120V 60Hz, and in Australia it is 230V 50Hz.

      The power supply is located at the back of the computer, usually at the top. However, many more recent tower computer cases house the power supply at the bottom back of the case. In a desktop computer case (all-in-one), the power supply is located at the back left or back right.
