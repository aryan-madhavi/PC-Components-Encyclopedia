      The <em><strong>Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU</strong></em>, has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing. <em>Designed for parallel processing</em>, the GPU is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering. Although they're best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).
      <br><br>
      GPUs were <em>originally designed to accelerate the rendering of 3D graphics</em>. Over time, they became more flexible and programmable, enhancing their capabilities. This allowed graphics programmers to create more interesting visual effects and realistic scenes with advanced lighting and shadowing techniques. Other developers also began to tap the power of GPUs to dramatically accelerate additional workloads in high performance computing (HPC), deep learning, and more.
      <br><br>
      The <em>GPU evolved as a complement to its close cousin, the CPU</em> (central processing unit). While CPUs have continued to deliver performance increases through architectural innovations, faster clock speeds, and the addition of cores, <em>GPUs are specifically designed to accelerate computer graphics workloads</em>.
      <br><br>
      GPUs come in <em>two basic types: integrated and discrete</em>. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card at all and is instead embedded alongside the CPU. A discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own circuit board and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.

      Applications of GPU are as follows - 
      <ol>
        <li>They are used in the gaming industry as GPUs are capable of rendering graphics in both 2D and 3D. With better graphics performance, games can be played at higher resolution, at faster frame rates, or both.</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning offer several exciting packages for GPU technology. Since GPUs have an exceptional amount of computational power, they can provide tremendous acceleration in workloads that take advantage of GPU's highly parallel design, such as image recognition. Many advanced learning technologies depend on GPUs working in combination with CPUs.</li>
        <li>GPU's parallel processing makes rendering video and graphics in higher quality formats easier and faster. Moreover, modern GPUs have specific media and display engines, which help video production and playback more power-efficient.</li>
