      <em><strong>Data storage</strong></em> refers to <em>magnetic, optical or mechanical media that records and preserves digital information</em> for ongoing or future operations.
      <br><br>
      With data storage space, users can <em>save data onto a device</em>. And should the <em>computer power down, the data is retained</em>. And instead of manually entering data into a computer, users can instruct the computer to pull data from storage devices. <em>Computers can read input data</em> from various sources as needed, and <em>it can then create and save the output</em> to the same sources or other storage locations. Users can also <em>share data storage with others</em>.

      Today, organizations and users require data storage to meet today's high-level computational needs like big data projects, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and the internet of things (IoT). And the other side of requiring huge data storage amounts is protecting against data loss due to disaster, failure or fraud. So, to avoid data loss, organizations can also employ data storage as backup solutions.

      Data storage is the <em>retention of information</em> using technology specifically developed to keep that data and have it as accessible as necessary. Data storage refers to the use of recording media to retain data using computers or other devices.<br>
      The most prevalent forms of data storage are as follows and each are ideal for different purposes -
      <dl>
        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> File storage</dt>
        <dd>
        File storage, also called file-level or file-based storage, is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data. In other words, data is stored in files, the files are organized in folders and the folders are organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> Block storage</dt>
        <dd>
        Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology used to store data into blocks. The blocks are then stored as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier. Developers favor block storage for computing situations that require fast, efficient and reliable data transfer.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> Object Storage</dt>
        <dd>
        Object storage, often referred to as object-based storage, is a data storage architecture for handling large amounts of unstructured data. This data doesn't conform to, or can't be organized easily into, a traditional relational database with rows and columns. Examples include email, videos, photos, web pages, audio files, sensor data, and other types of media and web content (textual or non-textual).

      The types of data storage devices are as follows -
      <dl>
        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> SSD and Flash Storage</dt>
        <dd>
          Flash storage is a solid-state technology that uses flash memory chips for writing and storing data. A solid-state disk (SSD) flash drive stores data using flash memory. Compared to HDDs, a solid-state system has no moving parts and, therefore, less latency, so fewer SSDs are needed. Since most modern SSDs are flash-based, flash storage is synonymous with a solid-state system.

        <dt><span class="dt" id="bullet">○</span> Hybrid Storage</dt>
        <dd>
          SSDs and flash offer higher throughput than HDDs, but all-flash arrays can be more expensive. Many organizations adopt a hybrid approach, mixing the speed of flash with the storage capacity of hard drives. A balanced storage infrastructure enables companies to apply the right technology for different storage needs. It offers an economical way to transition from traditional HDDs without going entirely to flash.
