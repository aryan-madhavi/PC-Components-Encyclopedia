      <em><strong>Workstation</strong></em>  is a <em>single user computer</em> that is <em>designed for technical or scientific applications</em>. It has a faster microprocessor, a large amount of RAM and high speed graphic adapters. It <em>generally performs a specific job with great expertise;</em> accordingly, they are of different types such as graphics workstation, music workstation and engineering design workstation.

      <span class="title">• Applications of Workstation Computer:</span><div class="line"></div><br>
      Any computer that has the following <b>five features</b>, can be termed as a workstation or can be used as a workstation -<br>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Multiple Processor Cores</b>: It has more processor cores than simple laptops or computers.
      </li>
      <li><b>ECC RAMs</b>: It is provided with Error-correcting code memory that can fix memory errors before they affect the system's performance.
      </li>
      <li><b>RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)</b>: It refers to multiple internal hard drives to store or process data. RAID can be of different types, for example, there can be multiple drives to process data or mirrored drives where if one drive does not work than other starts functioning.
      </li>
      <li><b>SSD</b>: It is better than conventional hard-disk drives. It does not have moving parts, so the chances of physical failure are very less.
      </li>
      <li><b>Optimized, Higher end GPU</b>: It reduces the load on CPU. E.g., CPU has to do less work while processing the screen output.
      </li>
      </ul>
